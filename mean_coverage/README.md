# Mean coverage
Mean coverage computes mean coverage and standard deviation of a single pseudopileup file.

## Input

Input ``mean_coverage``: 

1. Path of one of the common files obtained through the **common** exec. This is a pseudopileup.dat file.
2. Path of the output file (name could be e.g **mean_coverage_ancestor.dat**).
3. Max threshold: this threshold can be set at your discretion to select a coverage up to the maximum limit,  
ensuring that the standard deviation is not too large.

## Output

A txt file (example of an output):

65.8964 &rarr mean coverage  

14.1532 &rarr 1 std dev
